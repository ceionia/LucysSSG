<h1>Lucy's Makefile Static Site Generator for GNU/Linux</h1>
<p>so here's how i make my site. if you'd like to you can build one with this as well! what does it actually do? well...</p>
<ul>
    <li>templating</li>
    <li>markdown support (with kramdown)</li>
    <li>completely extendable! it's just a makefile</li>
</ul>
<p>"that's all?" yep. this is just my tool for making simple sites. i like it :3</p>
<p>how do you use it?</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="using.html">basic usage</a></li>
    <li><a href="templates.html">using templates</a></li>
</ul>
<p>you can get the software from this <a href="https://git.ceionia.com/lucia/LucysSSG">example site's repository</a>, or just get the <a href="Makefile">base Makefile</a>.</p>
<p>if you make your makefile do something cool, share it! maybe someone else will use it too ♥</p>
