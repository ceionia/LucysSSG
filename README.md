# Lucy's Makefile Static Site Generator for GNU/Linux
  
so here's how i make my site. if you'd like to you can build one with this as well! what does it actually do? well...  
  
 - templating
 - markdown support (with kramdown)
 - completely extendable! it's just a makefile
  
"that's all?" yep. this is just my tool for making simple sites. i like it :3  
how do you use it?  
  
 - [basic usage](https://ceionia.com/ssg-example/using.html)
 - [using templates](https://ceionia.com/ssg-example/templates.html)
  
if you make your makefile do something cool, share it! maybe someone else will use it too â™¥
